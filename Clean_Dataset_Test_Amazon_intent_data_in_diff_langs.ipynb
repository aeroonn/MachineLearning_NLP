        "# **BERTopic on Italian, German and English on Amazon_massive_intent dataset**\n",
        "In our earlier experiment with English news articles, the KeyBERT-inspired topic representations clearly outperformed basic frequency-based labels (c-TF-IDF), giving us cleaner and more meaningful descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then tested the same approach on German and French Amazon reviews, which are much messier due to slang, typos, and strong opinions. We trained separate BERTopic models for each language and applied the KeyBERT-style method to see if we could still get clear product-related topics.However, the results were much weaker: both languages reached coherence scores of only 0.10–0.14, far below the ~0.40 we achieved on the BBC News dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In this notebook,** we test whether the same strategy works in a multilingual setting using the **amazon_massive_intent dataset** in Italian and German. This dataset is simpler and cleaner than Amazon Reviews, so we want to see if the model performs better when there is less linguistic noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "We train separate BERTopic models for each language, just like we did with the Amazon Reviews experiments, and apply the KeyBERT-inspired representation to check whether we can extract clear and interpretable for **assistant command patterns**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goal:** To assess whether BERTopic can consistently uncover similar **intent-related clusters** across three different languages Italian, German, English in the massive dataset, and to analyze how language-specific phrasing influences cluster structure.\n",

        "The model is able to identify some meaningful intent-related themes in the Italian MASSIVE dataset. For example topic-1 showed somewhat clearer structure, capturing media-playback actions through verbs like **“mettere”** and **“metti”** (put/play) and nouns such as **“brani”** (songs). On the other hand, BERTopic in italian dataset produced several mixed or noisy clusters, indicating difficulty in extracting clean intent categories from short Italian utterances. However, the output also highlights key limitations. For instance, Topic 0 was dominated by extremely frequent conversational tokens such as **“sono”** (I am), **“favore”** (please), and even **“chiocciola”** (the @ symbol).\n",

        "\n",
        "The goal of this project was to replicate the success observed in our English news experiment and, to some extent, in the more challenging multilingual Amazon Reviews dataset, **using a simpler dataset to evaluate whether the model would perform better.** Additionally, we sought to compare how the Italian language behaves relative to the others. Previously, we experimented with the German Amazon multilingual review dataset, but the data proved too noisy due to its nature as a review corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although we were able to extract intent-related themes for Italian, German, and English, the quantitative metrics indicate that the results were again considerably less successful. The coherence scores for German and Italian were 0.29 and 0.18, respectively. We expected the English portion of the Amazon MASSIVE Intent dataset to perform better; however, it produced a coherence score of 0.19, which is also very low. In contrast, the BBC News dataset achieved a coherence score of 0.40, highlighting the performance gap. Although the coherence score for the German dataset increased slightly from 0.26 to 0.29, this improvement is minimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the Amazon Reviews dataset, we initially hypothesized that the model underperformed due to the nature of review data—texts that are short, informal, and heavily saturated with sentiment (e.g., “bad,” “perfect”), which complicates topic extraction. However, the Amazon MASSIVE Intent dataset is simple and clean, without slang, typos, or strong sentiment. Despite this, the model still performed poorly.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results suggest that the multilingual BERTopic model may still have notable limitations, particularly when applied to intent-based datasets across different languages.On the other hand, the availability of suitable, high-quality datasets in multiple languages is limited, which further constrains our ability to comprehensively evaluate BERTopic’s multilingual performance."
