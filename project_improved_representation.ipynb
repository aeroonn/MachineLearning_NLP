    "# BERTopic improved representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic models are great at finding clusters, but their labels often fail the human eye test by prioritizing frequent words over meaningful ones. This project focuses on this issue using the BBC News dataset. We start by building a standard BERTopic baseline (replicating the original paper's settings) and then upgrade the representation layer using a KeyBERT-inspired model. By decoupling the clustering from the labeling, we aim to show that semantic embeddings produce cleaner, more interpretable topics than standard frequency counts. This is later also validated with computing Topic-Coherence and Topic-Diversity (same as in the paper)."

    "### Results and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the impact of changing the representation model, we compared our Baseline (Standard c-TF-IDF with stopword removal) against the Improved (KeyBERT-Inspired) model. We used two metrics: Topic Coherence (NPMI) to measure semantic consistency, and Topic Diversity to measure the uniqueness of keywords across topics.\n",
    "Then we put the results side by side to see the difference. The expectation was that the **Baseline** keywords are more generic, while the **Improved** keywords are more specific and descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the table above, there is an improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coherence**: The KeyBERT-inspired model achieved a coherence score of 0.403, outperforming the baseline (0.277). This indicates that the top words selected by KeyBERT are more semantically related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diversity**: The diversity scores remained relatively stable (~0.35 to ~0.39). This suggests that while KeyBERT changes which words are selected, it does not reduce the vocabulary size or result in repetitive topics compared to the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This experiment demonstrates that while the clustering mechanism of BERTopic (finding which documents belong together) is powerful, the default c-TF-IDF representation can sometimes prefer frequent but generic words.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying a KeyBERT-inspired model, we successfully:\n",
    "- Increased the semantic coherence of the topics by more than 0.12 points.\n",
    "- Generated topic labels that are more descriptive and actionable for human analysts."
