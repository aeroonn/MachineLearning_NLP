    "# **BERTopic on German & French Amazon Reviews**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous experiment, we proved that **KeyBERT-Inspired representations** significantly outperform standard frequency-based labels (c-TF-IDF) for English news. They produce cleaner, more semantic topic descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we test if that same strategy holds up in a multilingual environment using **Amazon Reviews** in **German** and **French**. Reviews are \\\"messy\\\" data filled with slang, typos, and strong sentiment. We will train separate BERTopic models for each language and apply the KeyBERT-inspired representation to see if we can extract clear, interpretable product categories from raw customer feedback.\n"

    "This project aimed to replicate the success of our English News experiment on a more challenging, multilingual dataset of Amazon Reviews. While we successfully extracted interpretable product categories for both German and French, the quantitative metrics reveal that it was far less successful. The coherence scores for both languages are between **0.26 and 0.16**, which is significantly lower than the **~0.40** we achieved with the BBC News dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "These lower scores do not necessarily mean the model failed, they rather highlight the nature of the review data. Reviews are short, informal, and heavily saturated with sentiment (e.g., \"bad\", \"perfect\") which makes them harder to work with in topics extraction. While the KeyBERT-Inspired representation successfully identified specific items like \"LEDs\" it could not fully overcome the noise of raw text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bridge the gap between the score of **0.26** and our previous benchmark of **0.40**, future iterations with customized lemmatization and stop word removal preprocessing steps could potentially improve the results."
